# Flutter Sliver App Bar with tab bar

This sample app displays an appbar with a tab bar underneath it.  The app bar collapses
once the user scrolls through the content and the tab bar remains pinned
to the top of the screen.

Each tab bar hosts its own content and the scroll position of each tab is retained
when switching between tabs.
